Neutrino source above muon production threshold - Background
Hadronic system - Background = baryon/meson produced
Why can't the electrons be captured from electron neutrinos

Does oxygen only capture one type of muon? - only negative muons in a specific fraction

Gadolinium captures the neutrons which are released by the oxygen
What does the purity of the sample mean/why is high purity required
Eliminates the neutrino energy factor, only distance/flavor

Neutrino fluxes?

How do we know not massless
What does massive neutrinos imply with standard model
Meaning of mass inhibiting structure

Mixing angle determined by nature?

Capture frequency postulated to be independent of neutrino energy, gain percentage of neutrons of neutrino and anti-neutrino within a sample

Purity meaning and purpose?

1/2. What software exists currently
3. Within what programming paradigm
5. Meaning of calibrating the experiment

Article 1:
p4 - singlet vs triplet states for a p\mu atom?
p4 - Where did the remaining 18% (or 10% because light is because of lack of emission) go?
p4 - Is neutron production the emission or the conversion of protons, such that bound states produce one, but not emit
p5 - virtual pion meaning? Also what is the parenthetical notation
p5 - How are the proposed reactions similar?
p6 - what does partial lifetime meaning?
p7 - weak interaction == muon decay? lepton decay?
p7 - mesonic states distinct from electron states or replacing them
p7 - capture rate dependent on decay time, such that replies on CPT (symmetry)
p7 - How can you say muons don't decay into electrons if the principle weak interaction formula (p7) stated the decay into an electron - no other mass loss, only energy meaning?
p7 - heavy electron == excited state?

Article 2:
p2 - Left handed partner has any proper meaning?
p2 - CP violation fix by third generation, GUTs strong interactions
p2 - Does mixing mean oscillation or something else
p2 - Double beta decay, end point beta-decay anomalies
p3 - What does it mean, why they are the masses they are, why these, why do they exist

p3 - Entire mass see-saw mechanism section, Majorana particles, etc....????? - how does the see-saw prove they are Majorana or likewise for lack of conservation of total lepton
- Also definite flavors of quarks, weak charged current intezractions, mixed states
- Weak doublet, weak eigenstate meaning - eigenstate/doublet in weak interaction
p4 - Mass not associated with particular flavor?
p5 - What does it mean for the doublets to be SU(2)_L, and left and right handed components? How does this make it massless and conserved by family?
- Meaning of loop corrections?

Rex:
- Bosonic difference from fermions (exclusionary principle)?
- Do leptons and hadrons interact -> automatically weak?, can hadrons interacts with weak?
- Neutrinos only produce their cooresponding particles in interactions, Conservation of Lepton Number for Each Family (+- 1 per) - how with oscillation?, Conservation of Baryon Number, Conservataion of Strangeness, Topness, Bottomness, Charm (not weak)
- Why do particles have minimum kinetic energy? Does that just mean minimum possible maximum KE? (Smallest top of the range) - Hows does uncertainty give it?
- Wavelength perpendicular to energy? Why must it be continuous probability wavefunction?
- Why does decay into two pions violate CP? Does lack of parity imply the frame of reference matters?
- Pauli Exclusion == No Two Fermions in the Same State
- Quantum gravity is the graviton?

Griffiths:
- How does neutral interaction hurt parity, is it only for scattering?
- Least energy ideal?
- Why does crossing symmetry not require the photons by annihilation?
- How did Raines experiment know the inverse beta wasn't just the same as the inverse original without neutrino
- Wouldn't the spacing needed be twice the Compton wavelength of an electron
- Why is the Kobayash-Maskawa matrix give the sqrt probability for each component?
- Gluon coupling and why the OZI rule is valid, why less in short ranges?
- Meaning of coupling constant converging - interaction of Higgs field with others?

- No understanding of Tensor portions in Ch 3 or Einstein matrix notation
- No understanding of proof of always CM for massive particles

- How is SO(3) a rotation and how is it equal to SU(2)?

Artin:
Ch 2 - Known that d is the GCD versus another divider - Since it must be within the set, 		only if GCD
	 - Known m must be LCM why?
	 - How is the generated group found for some subset
	 - How are cosets equal if homomorphic result is equal
	 - injective = at most one from the domain, surjective = at least one, bijective = both
